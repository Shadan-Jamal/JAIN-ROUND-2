                    <p style="width: 80%; text-wrap: wrap;">The life cycle of a plant is the series of stages that a plant goes through from the beginning of its life until it produces seeds, which will give rise to the next generation. Here's an introduction to the general life cycle of a typical plant:
                        1. Seed Stage
                        Germination: The life cycle of a plant begins with a seed. Inside the seed, there's a tiny embryo of a plant along with stored food and a protective outer covering. When conditions are right (moisture, warmth, and sometimes light), the seed absorbs water and begins to swell. This causes the outer shell to crack open, and the embryo inside starts to grow.

                        2. Seedling Stage
                        Growth of Roots and Shoots: After the seed germinates, it grows roots that anchor it into the soil and start absorbing water and nutrients. Simultaneously, the shoot grows upwards towards the light. At this stage, the plant is called a 
                        seedling. It starts producing its first leaves and begins the process of photosynthesis to make its own food.
                        <br>
                        3. Vegetative Stage
                        Leaf and Stem Development: During this phase, the plant grows rapidly, producing more leaves, stems, and roots. This is the period when the plant is actively photosynthesizing, creating food for itself, and storing energy. It's growing but not yet producing flowers.
                        <br>
                        4. Flowering Stage
                        Production of Flowers: Once the plant is mature enough, it starts producing flowers, which are the reproductive organs of the plant. Flowers attract pollinators (like bees, butterflies, birds) and contain the plant's reproductive organs.
                        <br>
                        5. Pollination and Fertilization
                        Reproduction: Pollination occurs when pollen (male gamete) from the anther of a flower is transferred to the stigma (female part) of the same or a different flower. After pollination, fertilization takes place, where the male and female gametes fuse to form a zygote.
                        <br>
                        6. Fruit and Seed Formation
                        Seed Development: After fertilization, the zygote develops into a seed, and the ovary of the flower develops into fruit. The fruit protects the seeds and helps with their dispersal.
                        <br>
                        7. Seed Dispersal
                        Dispersal Methods: Seeds are dispersed in various ways â€“ by wind, water, animals, or by the plant itself (through mechanical means). This allows the new seeds to find suitable places to grow into new plants, starting the cycle all over again.
                        <br>
                        8. Death and Renewal
                        Completion of the Cycle: Once a plant produces seeds, it may die (especially annual plants) or enter a period of dormancy (in the case of perennials). The seeds will eventually grow into new plants, and the cycle continues.
                        This cycle is common to most plants, though there are variations depending on the type of plant and its specific environment.
